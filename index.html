                            <span class="mozilla-headline">I was born in <strong>April 1996</strong> and grew up in 
                                <strong>Winchester, Ontario, Canada.</strong> To make it a short story, 
                                I graduated high school in 2014 and earned my diploma in Radio Broadcasting 
                                from Algonquin College in 2017. The following year, I landed a part-time 
                                position at <strong>Jewel 98.5</strong> working promotions and as a casual 
                                on-air personality at their sister station <strong>Jewel 107.7</strong> 
                                in Hawkesbury, Ontario. I was moving up in the world, but everything changed
                                not just for me, but for <strong>everybody!</strong>

                        <h1 class="mozilla-headline">Change of Career</h1>
                            <span class="mozilla-headline">In March 2020, <strong>COVID-19</strong> swept through 
                                Canada and the entire world. 
                                With lockdowns in effect, I was let go and returned to work as a server in a 
                                retirement home. Having always excelled at math in high school, I was encouraged 
                                to apply for Computer Programming at Algonquin College in early 2024. After 7 years 
                                since my last graduation, I got <strong>ACCEPTED</strong> into the program! 
                                Starting from nothing, I went through the most challenging period of my life 
                                but achieved incredible grades through determination, passion, and help from 
                                amazing friends. There's only one way to go from here up!

                                I'm passionate about delivering quality web applications to clients. Through my ongoing 
                                studies in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, I'm committed to reaching 
                                the highest level of proficiency in web development.

                                of Computer Programming. My goal is not only to graduate but to network with 
                                industry professionals and volunteer with a web or mobile application company 
                                to gain real-world experience. The future is uncertain, but I know it's heading up!
