                            <span class="mozilla-headline">I was born in <strong>April 1996</strong> and grew up in 
                                <strong>Winchester, Ontario, Canada.</strong> To make it a short story, 
                                I graduated high school in 2014 and earned my diploma in Radio Broadcasting 
                                from Algonquin College in 2017. The following year, I landed a part-time 
                                position at <strong>Jewel 98.5</strong> working promotions and as a casual 
                                on-air personality at their sister station <strong>Jewel 107.7</strong> 
                                in Hawkesbury, Ontario. I was moving up in the world, but everything changed
                                not just for me, but for <strong>everybody!</strong>

                        <h1 class="mozilla-headline">Change of Career</h1>
                            <span class="mozilla-headline">In March 2020, <strong>COVID-19</strong> swept through 
                                Canada and the entire world. 
                                With lockdowns in effect, I was let go and returned to work as a server in a 
                                retirement home. Having always excelled at math in high school, I was encouraged 
                                to apply for Computer Programming at Algonquin College in early 2024. After 7 years 
                                since my last graduation, I got <strong>ACCEPTED</strong> into the program! 
                                Starting from nothing, I went through the most challenging period of my life 
                                but achieved incredible grades through determination, passion, and help from 
                                amazing friends. There's only one way to go from here up!

                            <span class="mozilla-headline">My current focus is front-end development. 
                                I'm passionate about delivering quality web applications to clients. Through my ongoing

                            <span class="mozilla-headline">In January 2026, I'll return for my final semester 
                                of Computer Programming. My goal is not only to graduate but to network with 
                                industry professionals and volunteer with a web or mobile application company 
                                to gain real-world experience. The future is uncertain, but I know it's heading up!
